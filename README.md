# NBA PRA
For now, just input the game ID into nba_test main function and the player name from the game (needs to be a top 300 player) and it will call the functions from nba_funcs.py


## TO RUN:
Change the game id in main() 
  -change gid to the current game
Change player name you want from the game, and the team name to change team color
